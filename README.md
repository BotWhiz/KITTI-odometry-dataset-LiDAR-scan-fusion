# KITTI-odometry-dataset-LiDAR-scan-fusion
This project aims to utilize the ground truth poses provided by the KITTI dataset to stitch together each LiDAR scan into a comprehensive map. Through this process, we can achieve high-precision environmental modeling, providing robust support for fields such as autonomous driving and robotic navigation.
